    <description>Instantly pick up items and open unlocked chests in the room with a single keypress. It works by teleporting the items to the player, but only if the items could be reached without taking damage (it won't teleport items behind rocks or spikes).

By default, the pickup of resources is activated by the C key on a keyboard, or Left stick button on an Xbox controller. This can be configured using the mod &quot;Mod Config Menu Pure&quot;.

These items are teleported:
- until limit of 99 is reached: penny, double, nickel, dime, lucky and golden coins ; single and double bombs ; single and double keys.
- always: golden bombs, golden keys, all cards, all pills, all bags, normal hearts, soul hearts, black hearts.

It only opens normal unlocked chests, the others are ignored.

All other items are NOT teleported, this includes batteries, charged keys, eternal, bone and rotten hearts.</description>
