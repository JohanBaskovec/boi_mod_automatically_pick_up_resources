    <description>Instantly pick up items and open unlocked chests in the room with a single keypress. It works by teleporting the items to the player, but only if the items could be reached without taking damage (it won't teleport items behind rocks or spikes).

By default, the pickup of resources is activated by the C key on a keyboard, or Left stick button on an Xbox controller. You can configure the controls and which items are picked up using the mod &quot;Mod Config Menu Pure&quot; https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2681875787

When picking up items, the mod doesn't waste resources: coins, bombs, keys and hearts are not picked up if the maximum would be exceeded (for example if you have 1/2 heart missing, it won't pick up a full heart). If you enable picking up bombs or keys, golden bombs and golden key  will always be picked up.

It only opens normal unlocked chests, the others are ignored.

All other items are NOT picked up, this includes batteries, charged keys, eternal, bone and rotten hearts.</description>
